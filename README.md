Process Control Simulator (Python)

Overview

This project is a simple Process Control Simulator built in Python to mimic basic industrial plant monitoring logic.
It simulates real-time sensor readings such as temperature, pressure, and flow rate, and triggers alerts based on abnormal process conditions.

The simulator is inspired by real-world industrial control systems used in process plants (e.g. chemical, oil & gas, and energy sectors).

Features

- Simulated temperature sensor monitoring
- Pressure and flow rate readings
- Automatic alarm detection for abnormal conditions
- Cooling system activation logic
- Simple console-based control system output
- Industrial-style alert messages

Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Linux (WSL)
- Nano (Terminal Editor)

How to Run the Simulator

1. Open Terminal / WSL
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the script:
   python3 process_control_simulator.py

Example Output

The system will display:

- Sensor readings (Temperature, Pressure, Flow Rate)
- Alerts when values exceed safe limits
- Recommended corrective actions (e.g. activate cooling system, check pump/pipeline)

Purpose of the Project

This project was created to demonstrate:

- Basic process control logic
- Industrial instrumentation concepts
- Automation thinking for plant operations
- Python programming applied to engineering simulations

Future Improvements

- GUI dashboard for live monitoring
- PID control simulation
- Data logging system
- Integration with real sensor inputs (IoT)
